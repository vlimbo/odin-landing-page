# Reflections

The project started with a little bit of a struggle. I got stuck trying to center the header divs.

It took me 4 hours and a good night of sleep to understand that in order to be able to use margin: 0 auto; The container itself cannot take up the entire line, it needs to have a set max width that gives it room to move.

After setting up the divs for the header and filling in the content the rest of the page was more or less the same.

# Main tool used - Flex-box

This project mainly wanted to test your understanding of flex-box. If you were to inspect the code - you will immidiately see the avid use of display flex to get the contents layed out on the page. After using it for a little while and getting a better understanding of how it works, its obvious how powerful this tool is to, and how much flexibility it actually is able to provide you.

# What I would have done differently

If I were to tackle this type of project again I would plan it better. Draw out a sketch of the different boxes on the page, and start to think of how I would lay this out. I beleive this comes even more important when responsive design is something you need to have in the back of your head at most times when creating websites. So a note to me for my next project, try to plan a little more, sketch out the website and see if you can visualize how I would set it up.
